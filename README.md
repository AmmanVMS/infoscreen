## Setup

Setup a system `Raspberry Pi OS Legacy 32 bit` with the user `pi`. All scripts with with links to that user. Once booted, you can follow these steps in the console of the pi.

Create SSH key:

```
ssh-keygen
```

Add the deploy key to https://github.com/AmmanVMS/infoscreen/settings/keys
You can get the deploy key with this command:

```
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Clone the repository

```
cd
git clone git@github.com:AmmanVMS/infoscreen.git
```

Link the autostart script:

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/
ln -st ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/ ~/infoscreen/autostart
```
Set screen rotation:

Add this to `sudo nano /boot/config.txt`:

```
# rotate 90deg
# see https://linuxhint.com/rotate-screen-raspberry-pi/#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Go%20to%20the,%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cleft%E2%80%9D%20options.
display_hdmi_rotate=3
```

Add autostart of screen off and update `crontab -e`:

```
# turn the screen off and on
0 21 * * * /home/pi/infoscreen/screen-switch off
0  9 * * * /home/pi/infoscreen/screen-switch on
# update the repository
0  9 * * * /home/pi/infoscreen/update
```

## Soldering & Wiring

It is possible to switch the screen off.
See these resources for the schematics:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_wiring_in_the_United_Kingdom  
  This explains that the brown cable should be interrupted by the relay.
- https://www.circuitbasics.com/5v-relays-in-the-raspberry-pi/  
  This explains how to control the relay with the Raspberry Pi.
- https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/27968772-turning-on-an-led-with-your-raspberry-pis-gpio-pins  
  This explains where the pins are.

See the `screen-switch` script for details of where to plug the electronics into the Raspberry Pi.

The relay interrupts the brown cable when the screen is switched off.
It is preferable to have the relay interrupt to switch off because the start and restart of the Raspberry Pi show what is happening. 

## Box

You can print the box and the lid. You can use FreeCAD to [export the files](https://wiki.freecad.org/Export_to_STL_or_OBJ) as STL and print them on a 3d printer.
The box has this size to fit in a VGA cable + adapter as well as plug sockets.
